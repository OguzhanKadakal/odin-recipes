    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        Combine flour, oregano, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian
        seasoning, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Add ground
        lamb and knead until thoroughly mixed together, about 3 minutes.

        baking sheet.

        Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway to ensure even browning, for

        Wrap loaf in aluminum foil and let rest for about 10 minutes. Slice as
