# Project Overview

This project is a hands-on exercise to practice and improve my basic HTML skills. I'm focusing on working with key elements such as headers, paragraphs, links, images, and lists. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of HTML structure and create well-organized web pages.

## What I'm Practicing
- **Headers**: Learning how to use `<h1>` to `<h6>` for proper content hierarchy.  
- **Paragraphs**: Structuring text content using `<p>` tags.  
- **Links**: Adding hyperlinks with `<a>` to navigate between pages or resources.  
- **Images**: Embedding visuals using the `<img>` tag.  
- **Lists**: Creating ordered and unordered lists with `<ol>` and `<ul>` to organize information effectively.
